## Instructions to view visualisation

## How It Works

The visualization is built using Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. Vega-Lite specifications can be compiled to Vega specifications, which in turn can be rendered using HTML, SVG, and Canvas.

Data for the visualization is sourced from Kaggle and has been pre-processed to fit the requirements of the Vega-Lite specification.
